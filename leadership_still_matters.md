# Leadership Still Matters in the Age of Engineering Efficiency

In today’s fast-paced tech world, the spotlight often shines on developer productivity and how AI tools are revolutionizing software development. We hear a lot about making things faster and cheaper, with innovations like [DX Core 4](https://getdx.com/research/measuring-developer-productivity-with-the-dx-core-4/), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), and [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/1svciRnHZvvr3Fj4ejeug) generating excitement.

But a key idea from [The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113934.The_Goal) by Eliyahu M. Goldratt still holds true:
> Improving one part of a system does not necessarily improve the performance of the system as a whole.

These tools can help teams move faster, but they can also accelerate failure. We’re now able to do the wrong things more efficiently than ever. That raises an important question: Are failed projects mostly the result of unproductive engineers or ineffective management?

As someone who works closely with both engineering and leadership teams, I would say that the core reasons many projects fail such things like poor leadership, vague priorities, and weak product vision. And instead of focusing only on engineering efficiency, we should take a closer look at how we define goals, manage scope, align with business strategy, lead teams and many other things which are not a part of engineering.

Real productivity isn’t just about speed. It’s about direction. And that still depends on good management. This is why it still matters.
