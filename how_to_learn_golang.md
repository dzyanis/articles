# How to Learn Golang

Golang is a *boring* language ‚Äî and that‚Äôs a compliment. It‚Äôs simple, fast, and pragmatic. It may not wow you with clever syntax tricks, but it's a great choice for building real-world software, business applications, and scalable backend services.

This guide aims to provide a practical and honest approach to learning Golang (also known as Go). There's no single "right" way to learn a programming language. Instead, I'll outline several paths to help you choose what best fits your style, background, and goals.

## Start with the Official Resources

The official [Go website](https://go.dev/) is one of the best starting points. It includes:

- [The Go Tour](https://go.dev/tour): A guided introduction to Go, with interactive code snippets  
- [Documentation](https://go.dev/doc/): Well-written and to the point  
- [Blog](https://go.dev/blog/): Updates and best practices from the Go team

## Online Courses

Class Central lists over 120 Go courses. Here are some notable options:

- [Programming with Google Go Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-golang) by Ian G. Harris (UC Irvine). One of the longest-standing and most reputable Go courses.

- [Go: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide/). Highly rated on Udemy, with comprehensive content.

- [Learn How To Code: Google's Go Programming Language](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/). Very practical and exercise-focused.

- [Ardan Labs ‚Äì Ultimate Go](https://www.ardanlabs.com/training/ultimate-go/). Advanced-level training by Go veterans. Not suitable for beginners, but excellent for serious developers.

## Learn by Example

If you prefer learning by reading code, try:

- [Learn X in Y Minutes (Go)](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/go/)  
- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) ‚Äî now officially recommended on the Go website

## Books

When it comes to books, I rely entirely on the Go team's recommended reading list:

- [*The Go Programming Language*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25080953-the-go-programming-language) ‚Äî Alan A. A. Donovan & Brian W. Kernighan  
- [*Get Programming with Go*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30025600-get-programming-with-go) ‚Äî Nathan Youngman & Roger Peppe  
- [*Concurrency in Go*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30413199-concurrency-in-go) ‚Äî Katherine Cox-Buday  
- [*Go Programming Blueprints*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24880488-go-programming-blueprints---solving-development-challenges-with-golang) ‚Äî Mat Ryer  
- [*Introducing Go*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27015358-introducing-go) ‚Äî Caleb Doxsey

## Learn by Practice

Writing Go code is the best way to learn.

[Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/go) is a highly recommended platform in the Gophers Slack community.  
However, it doesn't always cover the basics in depth, so it‚Äôs useful to combine it with books or tutorials.

## Join the Community

Connecting with others can accelerate your learning. Try:

- [Gophers Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/)
- [r/golang](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/) on Reddit

## Articles

There are countless Go articles, but the most essential one is:

- [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)

It teaches idiomatic Go and is referenced across the entire ecosystem.

## Mastering Go

Choose your learning method ‚Äî tour, code, course, or community ‚Äî and start building.

A great way to deepen your knowledge is to recreate familiar technologies from scratch.  
If you're looking for inspiration, the ["Build Your Own X"](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) list is an amazing resource.

My personal favorite is building a Redis-like database. There are many examples out there, and I‚Äôve started my own version:  
[Simple Key-Value Store](https://github.com/dzyanis/minikv/blob/main/README.md)
